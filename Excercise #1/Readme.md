1.Get your contacts data from LinkedIn as a CSV file
–A guide for downloading contacts is here: https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-my-linkedin-network-c4b232ab2ad0
2.Open the file in RStudio as a text file to clean up for import + import with `read_csv()`
3.Get the count of your contacts by their current employer + total count
4.Create nodes and edges dataframes to use with igraph
–I recommend using an add-on to igraph called tidygraph

–Nodes are your contacts (you can keep first name + 1 letter of last name as a label)
–Edges are based on your contacts being affiliated with the same organization; so you and me have a tie (edge) because we are both at McGill
5.[optional]: Share your data with the class (email the csv to me), plot the resulting network of all shared data
6.[optional]: color yourself + classmates differently from contacts – what do you see in this network structure?
